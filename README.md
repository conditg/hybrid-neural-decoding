# Quantum Hybrid Neural Decoding

### In this project, the brain signals from a monkey are decoded by an LSTM with Variational Quantum Circuits. These results are compared against a classical LSTM to show that Quantum ML may be able to handle higher learning rates and learn more in initial epochs than the classical benchmark.

# Main Results

The faster learning noted below can be attributed to a higher learning rate. When the Classical Model was trained with a comparably high learning rate, the loss was erratic and the model did not consistently converge - examples can be found in the Overview pdf.
