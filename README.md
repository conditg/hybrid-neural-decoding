# Quantum Hybrid Neural Decoding

### In this project, the brain signals from a monkey are decoded by an LSTM with Variational Quantum Circuits. These results are compared against a classical LSTM to show that Quantum ML may be able to handle higher learning rates and learn more in initial epochs than the classical benchmark.
